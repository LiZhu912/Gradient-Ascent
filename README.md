<h1>Gradient Ascent/Descent.</h1>

This quick program was made after a fascinating Math 230 Calc 3 lecture on gradient ascent and descent. The two programs were self-coded using Calculus
ideas from Penn State's Math 140 and Math 230. Because gradient descent has a common application in machine learning, I decided to also include a
gradient ascent program to reinforce my understanding of the subject.

**For Gradient Descent...**

The first function definition returns the funtion which will be minimized. A system of equations can also be solved
by passing in 2 functions f_1 and f_2 such that (f_1)^2 + (f_2)^2.
