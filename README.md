<h1>Gradient Ascent/Descent.</h1>

This program was made after a fascinating Math 230 lecture on gradient ascent and descent. The two programs were self-coded using Calculus
ideas from Math 140 and Math 230. While gradient descent is the most common application in machine learning, I decided to also include a
gradient ascent program to reinforce my understanding of the subject.

**For Gradient Descent...**

The return function of the first function definition returns the funtions which will be minimized. A system of equations can also be solved
by passing in 2 functions f_1 and f_2 such that (f_1)^2 + (f_2)^2.
